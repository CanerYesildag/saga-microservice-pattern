## What is it?
This is an example of Saga Patten wrote in Java 17 and Kafka. If you would like to run project, you have to add database and kafka  in your local machine or make dockerize
There are two type of architecture for this pattern: **Choreography** and **Orchestration**.
For this example I used Choreography one.
